## Description

I was motivated to create this project in order to make a professional portfolio to showcase the projects I am proud of and have worked on. Creating a portfolio allows all of my projects to be accessed on one page and for people accessing my project to learn more about me. This portfolio also includes ways to contact me and coming soon, will contain my resume. 

Thoughout working on this project, I learned how to write HTML and CSS code from scratch. I learned how to create flexboxes and how to include a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
